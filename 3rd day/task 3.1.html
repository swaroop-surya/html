	        <strong> An HTML element is a type of HTML <small>(HyperText Markup Language)</small> document component, one of several types of HTML nodes<small> (there are also text nodes, comment nodes and others)</small>.[vague] The first used version of HTML was written by Tim Berners-Lee in 1993 and there have since been many versions of HTML.</strong>

	         <br>

	         <strong> The most commonly used version is HTML 4.01, which became official standard in December 1999.An HTML document is composed of a tree of simple HTML nodes, such as text nodes, and HTML elements, which add semantics and formatting to parts of document <small>(e.g., make text bold, organize it into paragraphs, lists and tables, or embed hyperlinks and images)</small>. Each element can have HTML attributes specified. Elements can also have content, including other elements and text.</strong>

			In 1980, physicist Tim Berners-Lee, a contractor at CERN, proposed and prototyped ENQUIRE, a system for CERN researchers to use and share documents. In 1989, Berners-Lee wrote a memo proposing an Internet-based hypertext system.[3] Berners-Lee specified HTML and wrote the browser and server software in late 1990. That year, Berners-Lee and CERN data systems engineer Robert Cailliau collaborated on a joint request for funding, but the project was not formally adopted by CERN. In his personal notes of 1990, Berners-Lee listed "some of the many areas in which hypertext is used"; an encyclopedia is the first entry.[4]
			<br>
			The first publicly available description of HTML was a document called "HTML Tags",[5] first mentioned on the Internet by Tim Berners-Lee in late 1991.[6][7] It describes 18 elements comprising the initial, relatively simple design of HTML. Except for the hyperlink tag, these were strongly influenced by SGMLguid, an in-house Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML)-based documentation format at CERN. Eleven of these elements still exist in HTML 4.[8]

			<li>January 14, 1997</li>
			<li>HTML 3.2[15] was published as a W3C Recommendation</li>. <li>It was the first version developed and standardized exclusively by the W3C, as the IETF had closed its HTML Working Group on September 12,1996.[16]</li>
			<li>Initially code-named "Wilbur",[17] HTML 3.2 dropped math formulas entirely, reconciled overlap among various proprietary extensions and adopted most of Netscape's visual markup tags</li> <li> Netscape's blink element and Microsoft's marquee element were omitted due to a mutual agreement between the two companies</li> <li> A markup for mathematical formulas similar to that of HTML was standardized 14 months later in MathML</li>.

		<strong>
		<ul>
		    <li>December 18, 1997
			HTML 4.0[18] was published as a W3C Recommendation.<br> <li>It offers three variations:
			Strict, in which deprecated elements are forbidden
			Transitional, in which deprecated elements are allowed
			Frameset, in which mostly only frame related elements are allowed.</li>
			<br><li>Initially code-named "Cougar",[17] HTML 4.0 adopted many browser-specific element types and attributes, but also sought to phase out Netscape's visual markup features by marking them as deprecated in favor of style sheets. HTML 4 is an SGML application conforming to ISO 8879 – SGML.[19]<</li>
			<li>April 24, 1998<br></li>
			<li>HTML 4.0[20] was reissued with minor edits without incrementing the version number.</li>

		<strong>
		<ul>	
			<li>It was published as a W3C Recommendation. It offers the same three variations as HTML 4.0 and its last errata[22] were published on May 12, 2001.</li><br>
			<li>May 2000</li><br>
			<li>ISO/IEC 15445:2000[23] ("ISO HTML", based on HTML 4.01 Strict) was published as an ISO/IEC international standard.[24] In the ISO, this standard is in the domain of the ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 34 (ISO/IEC Joint Technical Committee 1, Subcommittee 34 – Document description and processing languages).[23]</li><br>
			<li>After HTML 4.01, there were no new versions of HTML for many years, as the development of the parallel, XML-based language XHTML occupied the W3C's HTML Working Group.</li><br>
